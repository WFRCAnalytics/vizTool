# vizTool

The vizTool is designed to help users explore and understand travel demand model (TDM) results by providing visualizations of various transportation metrics through maps and charts. Users can examine different data dimensions to support decision-making and explore the input data used in TDM calculations. With insights into travel behavior across geographies and transportation modes, the vizTool facilitates comparisons of information related to roadways, transit ridership, mode splits, socioeconomic factors, and access to jobs and households.
